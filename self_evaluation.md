# Arrays has been a bit of a struggle to understand the process. It has taken me waaaaayyy longer to get my brain around it, but I think I get it now. Lots of notes were taken.

# I think I would like to spend more time within the Array docs page to get a better feel for the methods and variety of ways to manipulate arrays.

# I dont think I have any questions as of yet, but do wonder what is a real world example of needing an array of booleans.
